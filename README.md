# SushiMCP

SushiMCP is a model context protocol server designed to assist developers with delivering context to their AI IDE's. It's simple to use and massively improves the performance of base and premium LLM models when generating code. The easiest way to get started is by registering SushiMCP with your client using the default configuration:

<br>

## Registering SushiMCP with an MCP Client

```json
{
  "sushimcp": {
    "command": "npx",
    "args": ["@chriswhiterocks/sushimcp@latest"]
  }
}
```

## Development

This project is not open for contibutions at the moment, but feel free to fork and extend the project under the terms of the AGPL-3.0-or-later license.

## Inspiration

SushiMCP was born out of frustration with AI assistants generating outdated code. While searching for an MCP that could retrieve llms.txt, I found mcpdoc by LangChain AI. I built a devtools-focused MCP server using their structure, with list_llms_txt_sources and fetch_llms_text tools inspired by it. Thanks, LangChain.
